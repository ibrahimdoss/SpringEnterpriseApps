Using XML files or annotations for configuration metadata has its own
advantages and disadvantages.
• XML files can get bigger easily which causes complexity but saves
source code from configuration info leaving all beans as POJOs.
• Annotations provide small and contextual information regarding beans
making them developer-friendly but they make source code depended
on annotations which are part of Spring and modification necessary
when configuration changes.
